# Implementation-of-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
The objective of the Project is to identify the relationships between car prices and various independent variables, providing the management with a powerful tool to understand and predict car pricing dynamics.

### Dataset

 The dataset used for the project is [CarPrice Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FHmYNLs9v0Enc-UExEMpitOFGsWvB2dP/view?usp=drive_link)

## 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset, containing various features related to car specifications and their corresponding prices, was loaded for analysis. Preprocessing steps included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to ensure that the data was in the optimal format for model training. The data was then split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

## 2. Model Implementation:

Five different regression algorithms were implemented to predict car prices:

1.Linear Regression

2.Descision Tree Regressor

3.Random Forest Regressor

4.Gradient Forest Regressor

5.Support Vector Regressor

### Linear Regression: 
 A simple yet effective model to understand the linear relationship between the features and car prices.
### Decision Tree Regressor: 
 A non-linear model that creates a tree structure to make predictions based on decision rules inferred from the data.
### Random Forest Regressor: 
 An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to improve prediction accuracy.
### Gradient Boosting Regressor: 
 Another ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting errors made by the previous ones.
### Support Vector Regressor (SVR): 
 A model that attempts to fit the data within a certain margin, optimizing for the best boundary.

## 3. Model Evaluation:

Each model's performance was evaluated using R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. These metrics provided insights into the accuracy and robustness of each model. The comparison allowed for the identification of the best-performing model as Random Forest Regressor

## 4. Feature Importance Analysis:

An analysis was conducted to determine which variables significantly impact car prices. Feature importance was evaluated using methods like feature importance scores from ensemble models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) and correlation analysis. This step provided valuable insights into which features are most influential in determining car prices.

## 5. Hyperparameter Tuning:

The best-performing model underwent hyperparameter tuning to further enhance its performance. Techniques such as Grid Search or Randomized Search were used to find the optimal set of hyperparameters, resulting in improved model accuracy and reliability.

## Conclusion:

The project successfully identified the relationships between car prices and various independent variables, providing the management with a powerful tool to understand and predict car pricing dynamics. The insights gained from the feature importance analysis and the best-performing model's predictions can guide future business strategies and market entry decisions.
